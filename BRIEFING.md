## Learning goals & some tips

For transparency and clarity, these are the learning goals we will be testing:

#### Frontend

- Basic knowledge of React
  - components
  - props
  - useState
  - useEffect
  - event listeners & handlers
- Routing & dynamic routing using react-router-dom
- Making a reducers that transform the redux state
- Using selectors to take state from the redux store and use it in your components
- Dispatching actions from your components to change the redux state
- Seperating reducers & actions & selectors
- Using async actions (redux thunk)
- Sending GET / POST / PATCH and DELETE requests using axios
- Setting an authorization header with a JWT to make an authorized request

#### Backend

- Starting and restarting a docker container running a postgres server
- Generating models & migrations using sequelize-cli
- Doing database validation using sequelize models (e.g. allowNull: false, unique: true)
- Implementing hasMany, hasOne and belongsTo relations
- Adding foreign keys to models in migrations
- Adding relations to sequelize models
- Generating seed data using sequelize-cli
- Creating, updating & deleting records from the database using sequelize models
- Querying the database using sequelize models
- Eager loading related models using sequelize `include`
- Implementing GET / POST / PATCH / DELETE routes in express
- Sending responses with express
- Setting status codes to responses in express
- Seperating routes using the express Router
- Using the auth middleware to manage authorization for routes in express

**TIP: Read the assignment carefully!** It is easy to accidentally deviate from an assignment, resulting in a frustrating homework experience. Taking the time to read the exercise can save you time and effort.

**TIP: Don't get stuck!** If you feel stuck, try taking a small walk, continuing on to a next step, or talking out loud about the problem you're facing (programmers call this "rubber-ducking"). Everybody can get stuck, but don't let it stop you.

## What are we building?

We are building a webapp where people can put up their artworks for auction and encourage other people to make more art. It is called `Heart Works`. It has multiple pages:

- Signup & Login pages (already implemented in the starter kit)
- A page with a list of artworks up for auction
- A detail page for artworks where you can bid or `heart` an artwork
- A form where you start an auction

It is recommended that you use the react-redux & express templates where the login / signup flow has been implemented.

### 3. As a user I want to give people hearts for their artwork, so I can encourage them to make more art

- Any user, logged in or not should be able to click a button `give heart`
- It increases the `hearts` property of an artwork by 1
- We do not keep track of who gave a heart to the artworks, just the amount of hearts the artwork has

| Criteria                                                                                     | Points |

### 4. As a user interested in buying people's art, I want to be able to make a bid, so I can show my interest in buying an artwork

- On the detail page for an artwork there should be a form with 1 field: `amount`
- This form allows a user to make a bid
- This should only be possible when a user is logged in
- The email value for the bid can be taken from the redux store
- Alternatively make an input for the email as well
- The minimum value of the form should be the highest bid + 1 euro

| Criteria                                                                                | Points |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| When a user is logged in we can see an number input for amount and button to `Bid`      | 1      |
| When the `Bid` button is pressed, it makes a POST request to the server                 | 1      |
| When the `Bid` button is pressed, A value for amount and email are sent to the server   | 0.5    |
| When the `Bid` button is pressed, A bid is created in the database                      | 0.5    |
| The bid created in the database has the correct `artworkId`                             | 1      |
| The new bid can be seen on the page                                                     | 1      |
| An Authorization header is set in the request                                           | 1      |
| The auth middleware is used on the server side to authorize the request                 | 1      |
| The minimum value of the input for amount in the frontend is the highest bid amount + 1 | 1      |
| If there are no bids yet the minimum value is the `minimumBid` value from the artwork   | 1      |
| The backend validates that the new bid is the highest bid so far                        | 2      |
| Total                                                                                   | 11     |

### 5. As an artist I want to be able to post an artwork, so I can make money with my art

- As an artist (a user with `isArtist: true` and who is logged in) you should be able to post an artwork
- You can build this feature by hardcoding the value of `isArtist` the dynamic value is the next feature
- If you're logged in and an artist you see a `Start an auction` tab in the navbar
- This leads to a form where you can post an artwork

| Criteria                                                                | Points |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| There is a link with `Start an auction` in the navbar                   | 0.5    |
| A user can only see this link when you are logged in                    | 0.5    |
| A user can only see this if the user object contains: `isArtist: true`  | 1      |
| Clicking `Start an auction` links to a page with a form                 | 1      |
| The form contains inputs for title, minimum bid & imageUrl              | 1      |
| When the form is submitted a POST request is sent to the server         | 1      |
| An Authorization header is set in the request                           | 1      |
| The auth middleware is used on the server side to authorize the request | 1      |
| The POST request updates the database with input from the user          | 1      |
| The artwork saved in the database has the correct `userId`              | 1      |
| The user sees a success message if the artwork was posted successfully  | 1      |
| The success message is an alert, confirm or prompt popup or console.log | -1     |
| Total                                                                   | 10     |

**Note: You can of course us an `Alert` bootstrap component as a message (just not window.alert())**

### 6. As an administrator to this website, I want users to be able to specify that they are artists, so I know how my platform is being used

- When signing up, we want to users to specify that they are artists
- We can do this by adding a checkbox to the form
- We will also have to write a migration to add a column `isArtist` to our table

| Criteria                                                                           | Points |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| A seperate migration is created to add a column `isArtist` to our users table      | 3      |
| A checkbox is added to the signup form                                             | 1      |
| The `signUp` action also sends a value for `isArtist` when posting to the server   | 1      |
| When the checkbox is checked on signup, the user created has `isArtist: true`      | 1      |
| When the checkbox is not checked on signup, the user created has `isArtist: false` | 1      |
| Total                                                                              | 7      |

### 7. Finishing up

- Self assess:
  - Make a file called `ASSESSMENT.md`
  - Copy the rubric below into it
  - Score your assessment in the column `Self`
  - Leave room for the evaluator to fill in the `Evaluator` column
- Write a reflection about this assessment & your learning process in `REFLECTION.md`:
  - What did you do well, process wise
  - What would you do differently next time to improve, process wise
- Commit your code and use messages when you commit, push it to your respository using `git push origin master`

| Criteria                                                                   | Points |
