Criteria: ~tried to follow step by step from the reader, but it was not easy for me because I got nasty errors for misspelling and case sensitivity. I even had to delete the previous server-side repository and create a new one, then I accidentally put the foreign keys while creating models and migration files. for that I got conflicts while setting up relations, it took me a while to solve that. The good thing is now I know where I should be careful for the next times.
