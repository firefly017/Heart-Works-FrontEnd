Criteria: ~tried to follow step by step from the reader, but it was not easy for me because I got nasty errors for misspelling and case sensitivity. I even had to delete the previous server-side repository and create a new one, then I accidentally put the foreign keys while creating models and migration files. for that I got conflicts while setting up relations, it took me a while to solve that. The good thing is now I know where I should be careful for the next times.
Feature 1: ~this feature is almost similar to the practice assessment, so here I followed step by stepprocedure of Matias's live coding session. <The artworks are displayed with their number of bids they have in the database> this feature is not done yet, but due to the time limit, I deceided to move on to get some easy points.
